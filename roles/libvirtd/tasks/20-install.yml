    # If libvirtd.service is enabled, systemd can perform socket-based

    # running so long as a client is connected or a domain is running, and will
    # automatically shut down if neither condition is true for some time (as of
    # this writing, 120 seconds).
    #
    # Starting it here does no harm, except that it unnecessarilyl consumes
    # system resources, and it causes ansible to produce tasks with a "changed"
    # state even after the host is correctly configured.
