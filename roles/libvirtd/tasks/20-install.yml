    # There's no need to start and enable libvirtd, as it's automagically
    # started when virt-manager connects. In addition, libvirtd will
    # automatically stop if no clients are connected and no domains are running
    # for some time (120 seconds on this host). Consequently, starting it here
    # means that ansible will produce tasks with a "changed" state even on a
    # correctly configured host.
